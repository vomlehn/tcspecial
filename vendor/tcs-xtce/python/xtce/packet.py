"""Runtime for packet codecs generated from a mission's XTCE document.

``tcs-xtce`` (in ``generator/``) turns the containers and meta-commands of a
mission database into Python dataclasses derived from :class:`Packet`.  The
generated code reads packets with a :class:`BitReader` and writes them with a
:class:`BitWriter` into a :class:`~xtce.ManagedBuffer`; this module provides
those and the integer, float, string and calibration helpers they call.  It
mirrors ``tcs_xtce::packet`` in Rust and ``xtce/packet.h`` in C and C++.

A :class:`Codec` owns one input and one output buffer, preallocated for the
largest packet it will see and reused until the codec is discarded.  A
:class:`Batch` carries several packets in one buffer, after their length, so
a receiver gets them all in two reads.
