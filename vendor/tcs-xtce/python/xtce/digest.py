"""An MD5 digest of what an XTCE document means.

Two programs that exchange packets were built from the same packet
definitions if their XTCE documents have the same digest, so each can
send the other its digest and compare, rather than describing the data in
every message.  The Rust (``tcs_xtce::digest``) and C/C++
(``xtce/digest.h``) runtimes compute the same digest.

The digest covers the document's elements, attributes and text, but not
what leaves its meaning the same: comments and processing instructions,
whitespace between elements and at the start and end of text, the order
of attributes, the namespace prefixes used, and the order of the children
of elements that hold unordered collections (``UNORDERED``), such as the
parameters of a ``ParameterSet``.

The document is read as XML 1.0 in UTF-8.  It is an error for it to be
malformed, to declare another encoding, to have a DOCTYPE, or to have a
root element other than ``SpaceSystem``.  It is the MD5 digest of this
encoding of the root element:

* an element is ``E`` followed by three fields: its name, its attributes
  and its content;
* a field is the number of bytes in it, in decimal, a colon, and the
  bytes;
* a name is ``{namespace}local`` for a name in a namespace, otherwise
  ``local``, in UTF-8; namespace declarations are not attributes;
* the attributes are each attribute's name then its value, as fields, in
  order of name (by their UTF-8 bytes);
* the content is the encodings of the child elements and of the text
  around them, in document order, or sorted by their bytes when the
  element's local name is in ``UNORDERED``;
* the text between two child elements (or before the first or after the
  last), with references and CDATA sections expanded and comments and
  processing instructions left out, has spaces, tabs, carriage returns
  and line feeds trimmed from both ends; if anything is left it is
  encoded as ``T`` followed by it as a field.

As XML requires, line ends are normalized to line feeds before anything
else, and tabs and line feeds in attribute values become spaces.

A mission whose definitions are split across several documents has one
digest for the set (``digest_set``, ``digest_files``): the MD5 digest of
the documents' encodings, sorted by their bytes and concatenated.  It
doesn't depend on the order the documents are given in, and the digest of
a set of one document is that document's digest.
