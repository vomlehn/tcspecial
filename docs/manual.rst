Introduction
============

.. note::
   TCSpecial has been designed for spacecraft and ground communication with high
   latency communication links. It is just as applicable for other environments,
   such as submersibles, drones, etc. Simply translate "spacecraft" to your
   device type.

Testing
=======
Testing is done with two programs:

* tcsmoc - Simulates an operations center/mission control application. It
  communicates to TCSpecial via UDP datagrams.

* tcssim - Simulates payloads using various types of communication protocols
  and errors.

PING
""""
Click on the Command menu, then click on the Ping menu item. The status
box will indicate a PING message has been sent. When received, the status
box will change to indicate a response has been received. If a response
wasn't received within the command timeout window, the status box will
indicate the time it stopped waiting.

Beaconing
^^^^^^^^^
TCSpecial sends a beacon at a configurable interval. Tcmoc displays the
following beacon colors:

steady grey
  Either no beacon message has been received yet or the system time has
  changed backwards

steady green
  A beacon message has been received within the expected time

blinking green
  One or more beacon messages has not been received within the expected time
  but this is within the acceptable number of lost messages

blinking yellow
  The number of lost beacon messages indicate a possible issue.

blinking red
  The number of lost beacon messages indicates a likely issue.
