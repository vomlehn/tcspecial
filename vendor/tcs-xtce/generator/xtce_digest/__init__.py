"""xtce-digest: an MD5 digest of what an XTCE document means.

The digest itself is computed by the runtime library, ``xtce.digest`` in
``python/`` (the Rust and C/C++ runtimes compute the same digest); see it
for what the digest covers.  This package re-exports it for the
``xtce-digest`` command, which also checks that each document is valid
XTCE before it digests it.
