"""Size report: the bits each packet field uses on the wire, and the bits it
needs.

The report reads only the mission's XTCE document.  A field's need comes
from what the document says about its values:

* an integer needs the fewest bits that hold its ``ValidRange`` (for an
  argument, the union of its ``ValidRangeSet``) in the same encoding, or as
  unsigned when the range has no negative values;
* an enumeration needs the bits for its smallest and largest listed values;
* a boolean needs one bit;
* an array or repeated entry needs its most elements times the need of
  one element;
* an aggregate needs the sum of its members' needs.

Little-endian encodings must be whole bytes, so their need is rounded up.
Integers without a ``ValidRange``, floats, and binary fields have no stated
need.  Fixed-size strings are flagged because shorter strings are padded, and
bits skipped by ``LocationInContainerInBits`` are counted separately.  The
``sizeInBits`` and ``signed`` attributes of engineering types are only hints
in XTCE, so they are not used.
