//! Runtime for packet codecs generated from a mission's XTCE document.
//!
//! `tcs-xtce` (in `generator/`) turns the containers and meta-commands of a
//! mission database into Rust structs that implement [`Packet`].  The
//! generated code reads packets with a [`BitReader`] and writes them with a
//! [`BitWriter`] into a managed [`Buffer`]; this module provides those and
//! the integer, float, string and calibration helpers they call.
//!
//! A [`Codec`] owns one input and one output buffer, preallocated for the
//! largest packet it will see and reused for every packet until the codec is
//! dropped.  A [`Batch`] carries several packets in one buffer, after their
//! length, so a receiver gets them all in two reads.
//!
//! Code generated with `--dynamic-allocations false` uses the
//! fixed-capacity types of [`crate::fixed`] for arrays, strings and binary
//! fields, and the `fixed_*` readers here, so it never allocates.  Encode it
//! with a `Codec` made by [`Codec::for_packet`], whose output buffer never
//! grows, and decode it from a slice with [`Packet::decode`].
